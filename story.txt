once upon a time there was a girl named Saanvi, she loved to dance. She along with her two classmates Vernika and Rakshita participated in a traditional dance which was organised in her school. But unfortunately their dance got cancelled.
But they wanted to participate in anual day function, so they requested their dance teacher for the same but she always ignored them.
