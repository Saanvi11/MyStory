once upon a time there was a girl named Saanvi, she loved to dance. She along with her two classmates Vernika and Rakshita participated in a traditional dance which was organised in her school. But unfortunately their dance got cancelled.
But they wanted to participate in anual day function, so they requested their dance teacher for the same but she always ignored them.
So they went to their class coordinator. But she was busy in preparations so she also ignored them. we really wanted to participate so we wne to principal sir's office with our problem. he sent us with one ma'am to table tennis room where dance practise of class 11 and 12 was going. 
and so like this those three people of class 6 got into a dance of class 11th.
